## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this project was to visualize bike sharing data from New York City to share with investors for the purpose of starting up a similar business venture in Des Moines, Iowa. The goal was to show potential investors peak demand and key demographics of users, and then explain how the business plan could be modified to serve the local community. 

### Resources
 - Data Source: 201908-citibike-tripdata.csv
 - Software: Jupyter Notebook, Tableau Public, Python 3.7.2
 
## Results

For New York City, the results of the visualizations suggest that the key demographic to target would be males within bike commuting distance of their employment and near tourist attractions.

The opening dashboard on the story quickly conveys that most users are subscribers, male, and tend to use bikes most frequently during commuting hours, which could indicate that the most frequent users will be locals. In NYC where parking is a premium and many residents do not have the space to store a bike, bike sharing is beneficial not just for tourists or casual users but for locals in their commutes.

These two charts reiterate that the most common bike usage areas in NYC are in the Manhattan area.

This line graph indicates that the duration of most bike rides is below 10 minutes, with most users biking for only 5 minutes. This could indicate that most users are biking within short distances. Or in the instance of tourists, that bikes are in high demand and being resused frequently.

By gender, males frequently bike for less than ten minutes. Females followed the same trend, but had significantly fewer users.

This graph seeminly reflects that the most users and the highest demand for bikes is during commuting hours (around 8 am and then 5 to 6 pm). On weekends, when users would most likely be tourists, demand was evenly spaced between 11 am and 5 pm.

This chart reemphasizes that males are the most frequent users of City Bikes, and that key demand is during commuting hours.

In this chart, it shows that most bikers subscribe to the service, which would indicate that they are locals. In addition, it highlights that most users are male, and that demand is strongest during commuting hours.

## Summary

Based on the analysis of bike sharing data from New York City and conveyed in a visually appealing manner, it appears likely that the majority of the City Bike users are locals. In NYC, where parking is limited, streets are congested, and bike storage is problematic bike sharing seems to be a profitable venture. In addition to local commuters, many tourists also likely take advantage of the bikes to visit popular sites. 

In regards to further analysis on New York City bike sharing, it would be beneficial to explore the location of subway stops and bike starting and drop off locations. It is probable that many of the subscribers utilize both public transportation and bike sharing. Additional information that would support whether most of the usage is for commuters would be to look at the age of users. Some of the data in the file is corrupted because it indicated that some of the users were born in the 1800s, so data would need to be cleaned before using. 

In regards as to whether bike sharing would be profitable in Des Moines, significantly more information would need to be gathered for investors. Key differences between Des Moines and NYC include that population density is far lower in the former. Parking is not considered a significant issue, and public transportation is not as widely used. In addition, it would need to be studied how far people tend to communute to work in Des Moines. In NYC with the subway and the vast number of towering apartment buildings, most commuters are likely more local. Furthermore, additional research into the tourist industry in Des Moines would be needed. A start up bike sharing program in Des Moines would likely be on a much smaller scale and the area would need to be highly researched to ensure that the venture is profitable.
